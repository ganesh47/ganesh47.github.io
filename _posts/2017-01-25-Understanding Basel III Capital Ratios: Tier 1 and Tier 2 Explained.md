Under Basel III, capital adequacy is a cornerstone of prudent banking regulation. It ensures that banks have enough capital to absorb losses, withstand financial stress, and continue operations without threatening the broader financial system. Capital ratios are the key metrics regulators use to monitor the solvency and risk-bearing capacity of a financial institution.

The framework introduced by Basel III — as an enhancement over Basel I and Basel II — focuses heavily on improving both the quality and quantity of capital that banks hold, while also addressing issues related to risk exposure and procyclicality.

## What is Capital Adequacy?

Capital adequacy is the measure of a bank’s capital, expressed as a percentage of its risk-weighted credit exposures. It reflects the bank’s ability to meet its obligations and absorb unexpected losses without relying on government bailouts.

The **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)** is calculated as:

```
CAR = (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) / Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)
```

Basel III not only mandates minimum capital ratios but also introduces capital buffers — like the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) — to provide an additional margin of safety.

## Tier 1 Capital: Going Concern Capital

Tier 1 capital is the highest quality capital — it is the capital that can absorb losses while a bank is still operating (i.e., a going concern). Within Tier 1, Basel III distinguishes two components:

### Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1):
This is the most loss-absorbing form of capital and includes:
- Common shares issued by the bank that are fully paid-up
- Retained earnings
- Other comprehensive income (OCI)
- Reserves that are available to absorb losses

### Additional Tier 1 (AT1):
These are hybrid instruments that can be converted into equity or written down when a bank’s capital falls below a threshold. They include:
- Perpetual bonds with no maturity
- Non-cumulative preference shares

These instruments must be subordinated to depositors and senior creditors and must not create obligations for fixed payments.

### Regulatory Requirements:
- **CET1 must be at least 4.5% of RWA**
- **Total Tier 1 (CET1 + AT1) must be at least 6.0% of RWA**

Banks are also expected to maintain an additional **Capital Conservation Buffer** of 2.5% of RWA, bringing the effective CET1 requirement to 7.0% under normal circumstances.

## Tier 2 Capital: Gone Concern Capital

Tier 2 capital represents supplementary capital that can absorb losses **in the event of the bank’s failure** (i.e., a gone concern). These instruments are not expected to absorb losses during normal operations.

### Components:
- Subordinated term debt with a minimum original maturity of five years
- Instruments with a step-down approach to amortization in the final five years before maturity
- General loan-loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of RWA

Tier 2 instruments must be subordinated to depositors and general creditors and should not provide incentives to redeem.

### Regulatory Requirement:
- Tier 1 + Tier 2 must together constitute at least **8.0% of RWA**
- With the Capital Conservation Buffer, the total required capital increases to **10.5%**
- In periods of excessive credit growth, a **Countercyclical Buffer** may increase this requirement further by up to 2.5%

## Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA): The Denominator

The denominator of the capital ratio — Risk-Weighted Assets — reflects the bank’s exposure to credit, market, and operational risk. Each asset on the balance sheet is assigned a risk weight, depending on its perceived riskiness:

- Cash and sovereign bonds from stable governments: **0%**
- Mortgages: **50%**
- Corporate loans: **100%**
- Equity exposures: **150%** or higher

Banks must also assess off-balance-sheet exposures (e.g., loan commitments, guarantees) using credit conversion factors.

RWA ensures that capital requirements are sensitive to the risk profile of a bank, not just its size.

## Beyond the Minimum: Buffers and Leverage

Basel III doesn’t stop at minimum ratios. It includes:
- **Capital Conservation Buffer**: An additional 2.5% CET1 buffer to be maintained during normal times.
- **Countercyclical Capital Buffer**: National regulators may impose up to 2.5% additional CET1 in times of excessive credit growth.
- **Leverage Ratio**: A backstop measure requiring Tier 1 capital to be at least 3% of total exposure, regardless of risk weight.

These enhancements ensure that banks remain well-capitalized across economic cycles.

## Final Thoughts

Capital is not just a balance sheet number — it is a signal of trust, resilience, and preparedness. Basel III brings rigor to how capital is defined and measured, creating a more resilient global banking system.

> “Capital is confidence — and Basel III turns that confidence into quantifiable thresholds.”

Understanding the intricacies of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital helps regulators, investors, and banking leaders ensure that financial institutions are built to last — not just to comply.
