The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has always been a powerful abstraction layer, and its memory management system — particularly garbage collection (GC) — is a critical part of its performance story. As of mid-2016, the HotSpot JVM ships with several GC algorithms, each tailored to different kinds of workloads and allocation patterns.

Understanding how these collectors differ and where each shines is key to tuning your applications for optimal performance.

## 1. Serial Garbage Collector

### Overview
The Serial GC is the simplest of the bunch. It uses a single thread for both minor and major collections.

### When to Use
- Best suited for single-threaded or small heap applications
- Useful in constrained environments (embedded systems, small desktop apps)

### Pros
- Minimal overhead
- Predictable pauses

### Cons
- Not suitable for modern multi-core systems
- Long stop-the-world (STW) pauses for larger heaps

---

## 2. Parallel Garbage Collector (Throughput Collector)

### Overview
Also called the "Throughput Collector", it performs minor collections in parallel and is designed to maximize application throughput.

### When to Use
- Applications that prioritize high throughput over low latency (batch jobs, backend services)

### Pros
- Uses multiple threads to speed up GC
- Good default for many server-side applications

### Cons
- Still causes STW pauses
- Not ideal for latency-sensitive applications

---

## 3. CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) Collector

### Overview
CMS was introduced to minimize GC pause times by performing most of its work concurrently with the application.

### When to Use
- Low-latency applications (web servers, real-time systems)

### Pros
- Shorter pause times
- Concurrent marking and sweeping phases

### Cons
- Fragmentation issues due to no compacting
- More CPU intensive

---

## 4. G1 (Garbage First) Collector

### Overview
G1 is designed for large heaps and attempts to balance throughput and low-pause requirements. It divides the heap into regions and performs incremental GC operations.

### When to Use
- Applications with large heaps (multi-GB)
- Systems requiring predictable pause times

### Pros
- Predictable pause times with tuning (`-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis`)
- Compacts memory to reduce fragmentation
- Concurrent and parallel phases

### Cons
- More complex tuning
- Slightly higher overhead compared to Parallel GC

## Comparison Summary

| Collector | Pause Time | Throughput | Heap Size | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Serial   | High        | Low        | Small     | Desktop, Embedded |
| Parallel | Medium      | High       | Medium    | Batch, Backend Services |
| CMS      | Low         | Medium     | Medium    | Low-latency Web Apps |
| G1       | Low-Medium  | High       | Large     | Mixed Workloads, Large Heaps |

## Choosing the Right GC: Context Matters

- If you're building a simple desktop utility or running on a constrained device, **Serial GC** is fine.
- For batch jobs or services where maximum throughput is key, **Parallel GC** is a good fit.
- If latency is critical, and you're running on moderate heap sizes, **CMS** is worth a look.
- For applications with large heaps and a need for predictable performance, **G1 GC** offers the best balance.

## Final Thoughts

In 2016, the JVM GC landscape provides a rich toolkit. While G1 is emerging as the default for many use cases, understanding the trade-offs between the available collectors can lead to significant performance gains.

Choose wisely — and measure obsessively.
