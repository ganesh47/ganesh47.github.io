While capital adequacy addresses a bank’s ability to absorb losses, Basel III also places significant emphasis on **liquidity management**. Liquidity risk — the inability to meet short-term obligations — played a central role in the 2008 financial crisis. Basel III introduces two key liquidity ratios to safeguard against it:

- **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)**
- **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)**

These two metrics ensure that banks not only have enough high-quality assets to survive a liquidity shock, but also maintain sustainable funding over the long term.

## Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)

The **Liquidity Coverage Ratio** is designed to ensure that a bank holds enough **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)** to meet its **net cash outflows** over a 30-day stress period.

### Formula:
```
LCR = High-Quality Liquid Assets / Total Net Cash Outflows over 30 Days >= 100%
```

### High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA):
Assets must be:
- Easily and immediately convertible to cash in private markets
- Free of encumbrances
- Of high credit quality and market liquidity

Examples include:
- Level 1: Cash, central bank reserves, sovereign debt (0% haircut)
- Level 2A/2B: Corporate debt, covered bonds (subject to haircuts and caps)

### Net Cash Outflows:
Net outflows are calculated by applying regulatory run-off factors to liabilities and inflows:
- Customer deposits may have a 3%-10% assumed run-off
- Wholesale funding may be assumed to run off at 25%-100%
- Credit lines and derivatives are included based on drawdown assumptions

### Regulatory Objective:
To ensure that a bank can survive a **30-day market-wide liquidity stress** without external funding support.

## Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

Where LCR is short-term, the **Net Stable Funding Ratio** promotes medium- and long-term funding stability. It ensures that long-term assets are funded with stable liabilities.

### Formula:
```
NSFR = Available Stable Funding (ASF) / Required Stable Funding (RSF) >= 100%
```

### Available Stable Funding (ASF):
ASF is the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over a one-year horizon:
- Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital: 100% weight
- Retail deposits: 90%-95% depending on maturity and stability
- Long-term wholesale funding: 50%-100% depending on maturity

### Required Stable Funding (RSF):
RSF is based on the liquidity characteristics and maturity of the bank's assets:
- Loans with maturity >1 year: 85%-100% RSF
- Interbank loans and marketable securities: 10%-50% depending on quality and maturity
- Derivatives and off-balance exposures also contribute to RSF

### Regulatory Objective:
To reduce reliance on volatile short-term wholesale funding and promote **structural funding resilience**.

## Why Both Ratios Matter

LCR protects against **short-term liquidity shocks**, while NSFR builds long-term funding resilience. Together, they:
- Promote prudent asset-liability management
- Limit risk of funding mismatches
- Encourage stable funding sources like retail deposits

For banks, compliance means more than holding cash — it requires deep integration of liquidity models into daily operations and risk systems.

---

## Technology Implications

Meeting LCR and NSFR requirements demands:
- Real-time cash flow and liquidity tracking
- Asset classification engines to determine HQLA eligibility
- Behavioral modeling for deposit run-off rates
- Stress testing and scenario modeling platforms

Banks must invest in data quality, cross-entity aggregation, and risk analytics to generate compliant reports and make strategic funding decisions.

## Final Thoughts

Liquidity is the oxygen of banking — invisible when abundant, critical when scarce. Basel III embeds liquidity risk into the regulatory DNA of banking with LCR and NSFR.

> “Capital gives you time. Liquidity buys you survival.”

By aligning short-term cash buffers and long-term funding strategies, these ratios foster a more stable, crisis-resilient financial system.
