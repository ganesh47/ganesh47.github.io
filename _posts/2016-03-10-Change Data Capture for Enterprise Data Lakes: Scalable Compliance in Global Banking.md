As of March 2016, large financial institutions are under constant pressure to provide **timely, accurate, and auditable regulatory reports**. With diverse, siloed systems across geographies, the question is no longer _if_ data centralization is needed — it’s _how_ to do it **securely, scalably, and in near real-time**.

One of the most powerful tools in this architecture is **Change Data Capture (CDC)** — the ability to identify and stream changes from transactional systems **without disrupting them**, and replicate those changes into a central **Hadoop-based enterprise data lake**.

## Why CDC Matters in Global Banking

Large banks operate:

- Across **dozens or hundreds of systems** — core banking, trading, risk, compliance, CRM
- In **multiple formats and databases** — Oracle, DB2, mainframes, SQL Server, SAP, more
- Under **regulatory scrutiny** that demands transparency, lineage, and reproducibility

### Problems with traditional ETL:

- High latency (batch windows)
- Poor scalability
- Risk of data drift or inconsistency
- Expensive licensing and integration constraints

### What CDC enables:

- **Low-latency replication** without full-table scans
- **Event-driven architecture** for data lake ingestion
- Precise tracking of inserts, updates, deletes
- Better alignment with **regulatory lineage and auditability**

## CDC + Hadoop: An Architectural Fit

The Hadoop ecosystem — particularly in 2016 — is well-suited to absorb CDC streams at scale:

- **Kafka** for change event ingestion
- **Flume / NiFi** for secure, policy-managed streaming
- **HDFS / ORC / Parquet** for efficient, append-only storage
- **Hive / Impala / Presto** for SQL-based exploration
- **Ranger / Knox / Sentry** for governance and fine-grained access

This architecture enables:

- **Separation of compute and storage**
- **Immutable append-only logging** of changes
- **Schema-on-read flexibility** for evolving systems
- **Shared infrastructure** across compliance, risk, finance, and analytics

---

## How a CDC Pipeline Works

1. **Capture** changes from source (log-based or trigger-based)
2. **Stream** events to Kafka (one topic per source/table)
3. **Ingest** into HDFS using structured sinks (e.g., HBase, Hive, ORC)
4. **Partition** data by timestamp, source, or transaction type
5. **Audit** every step via metadata layers

## Real-World Use Case: Regulatory Reporting

Imagine a global bank needing to comply with:

- **BCBS 239** (risk aggregation and reporting)
- **MiFID II** (trading transparency)
- **FATCA / AML** (compliance and customer tracking)

Instead of building dozens of siloed reporting pipelines, a **CDC-enabled data lake** offers:

- **Consolidated golden data**: Transactions, positions, reference data
- **Reproducibility**: Historical replay of change logs
- **Shared lineage**: From source to report
- **On-demand query**: For internal or external auditors

For example, a Hive query can join customer KYC data from CRM with transaction flows from DB2 captured via CDC — powering a FATCA report **without duplicating ETL logic**.

---

## CDC Integration in Practice

- **Tools**: Attunity, Debezium, GoldenGate, IBM IIDR
- **Formats**: Avro, JSON, Protobuf, or custom record schemas
- **Governance**: Tags for PII, encryption in motion and at rest
- **Partitioning strategies**: Time-based, customer-based, system-of-record-based

CDC doesn’t just solve ingestion. It enables **eventual unification of data** across silos.

---

## Design Considerations

- **Idempotency**: Ensure that duplicates don’t break downstream systems
- **Late-arriving data**: Handle out-of-order events for correctness
- **Retention**: Set TTL for change logs and raw events
- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive fields, integrate with LDAP/Kerberos

## If You’re Curious…

- Explore using Debezium with Kafka + Hive
- Benchmark CDC vs. traditional ETL latency
- Study GDPR and BCBS 239 requirements from a lineage perspective
- Design a CDC audit table with replay capability for regulatory queries

> “In a world where regulation is constant and change is inevitable, CDC gives you both traceability and agility.”

In 2016, Change Data Capture is not just an ingestion strategy — it's the **nervous system** of a modern, governed, and performant enterprise data lake.
