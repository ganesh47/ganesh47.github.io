By May 2016, Apache HBase had firmly established itself as a go-to NoSQL database for **low-latency, high-volume, and sparse data** use cases. But what makes HBase interesting — and often misunderstood — is how it fits into the **CAP theorem** model for distributed systems.

Let’s revisit CAP and explore how HBase behaves under each axis, and why it makes the trade-offs it does.

## CAP Theorem Recap

Eric Brewer’s CAP theorem (formally proven in 2002) states that a distributed system can offer **at most two** of the following three guarantees:

- **Consistency (C)**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
- **Availability (A)**: Every request receives a (non-error) response — without guarantee that it contains the most recent write
- **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate even when network partitions occur

## HBase: CP System (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)

HBase prioritizes **consistency and partition tolerance**.

### Consistency
- HBase provides **strong consistency per row**: updates to a single row are atomic
- Reads always reflect the latest write (no eventual consistency)
- Row-level operations are isolated due to HBase’s internal **RegionServer** coordination

### Partition Tolerance
- HBase is built on top of **HDFS**, which is inherently partition-tolerant
- Regions are distributed across nodes, and HBase ensures failover using **Zookeeper**

### Availability Trade-off
- If the RegionServer managing a specific region goes down, that region becomes temporarily **unavailable** until failover completes
- HBase **will not serve stale reads** from replicas to maintain consistency

This makes HBase a **CP system** under the CAP theorem — trading **availability** for guaranteed consistency and partition tolerance.

## What This Means in Practice

### You Get:
- **Linearizable reads and writes per row**
- Confidence that when a write succeeds, it's visible to future reads
- Predictable data correctness in multi-step workflows (e.g., updates + lookups)

### You Don’t Get:
- Multi-row or multi-region atomicity (unless implemented at the app level)
- Availability if partitions or RegionServers are misbehaving
- Tunable consistency (as in Cassandra or Dynamo)

---

## Design Features Reflecting CAP Trade-offs

### Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
- Every write is logged before being applied
- Guarantees durability and recoverability post-crash

### MemStore + HFile Flush
- Writes go to in-memory MemStore, then flushed as immutable HFiles
- Guarantees consistency while leveraging HDFS durability

### Zookeeper Coordination
- Manages leader election and region assignments
- Enforces consistency through coordinated region movement

## Alternative Access Patterns and Comparison

| System       | CAP Profile | Consistency Type | Use Case Focus                |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **HBase**    | CP          | Strong per-row   | Time-series, log-structured   |
| **Cassandra**| AP          | Tunable          | High availability, analytics  |
| **MongoDB**  | CP/AP hybrid| Tunable          | General-purpose, app-first    |
| **DynamoDB** | AP          | Eventually Consistent | Scalable key-value workloads |

HBase makes the **opposite trade-off** compared to high-availability-first systems like Cassandra — favoring **correctness over uptime in the face of partitions**.

## If You’re Curious…

- Use `hbase shell` to inspect region assignments and failover
- Simulate RegionServer restarts and observe availability impact
- Explore timeline consistency in HBase’s replication model
- Read about coprocessors and region-based access patterns

> “In distributed systems, you can’t have it all. But with HBase, you get correctness you can build on.”

In 2016, understanding CAP isn't just academic — it's practical. Tools like HBase make explicit trade-offs that affect how we design, scale, and reason about real-world data systems.
