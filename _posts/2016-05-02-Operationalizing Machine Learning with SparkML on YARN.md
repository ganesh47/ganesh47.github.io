By May 2016, **SparkML** had emerged as a practical and scalable way to **build and deploy machine learning pipelines** directly on distributed infrastructure — and with **YARN** as the resource backbone, operationalizing ML at scale had never been more straightforward.

SparkML brought **structured APIs**, **pipeline abstractions**, and seamless integration with **Scala**, making it possible to move from experimentation to production within the same ecosystem.

## Why SparkML Matters

- **DataFrame-based pipelines** make ML workflows consistent with SQL, ETL, and feature engineering
- **Cross-validation and parameter tuning** are built-in
- **Serialization support** makes models portable across jobs
- **Runs on YARN**, leveraging Spark’s distributed scheduling and fault-tolerant execution

Example:

```scala
val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(Array(tokenizer, hashingTF, lr))
val model = pipeline.fit(trainingData)
model.write.overwrite().save("hdfs:///models/text-classifier")
```

---

## Operational Benefits

- **Batch and streaming pipelines** use the same APIs
- **YARN containers** isolate model training and inference jobs
- **Scala and Spark shell** enable rapid iteration and deployment
- Integration with **Hive, HDFS, Kafka** allows complete ML lifecycle on a single stack

---

## If You’re Curious…

- Explore the `PipelineModel` and `CrossValidator` APIs
- Run a text classification job on YARN using Spark-submit
- Benchmark training time with different executor settings
- Save and reload models from HDFS between job runs

> “Machine learning on YARN is no longer a science experiment — it’s becoming a production pipeline.”

In 2016, SparkML and YARN are quietly reshaping how organizations build **reproducible, scalable, and operational ML systems** in the enterprise.
